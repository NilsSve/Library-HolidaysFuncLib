# Library-HolidaysFuncLib

The `oCalendarHolidays.pkg` contains all the basic holiday date functions.

In addition to the `oCalendarHolidays` package, there are also specific National Holidays Date Function Libraries that can be streamlined for each individual country.

See the collection of country-specific libraries in `CountryPackages.pkg`. Use these files as templates for developing your own country-specific holiday package.

Use the HolidayFuncLibDemo repo to showcase how this library can be used.
